*As part of the Master in Design for Distributed Innovation (MDDI) program, my teammates and I are creating an eating utensil that is made from all natural materials. Currently, I am preparing to make one version with agar as the matrix, linen/flax as the reinforcer, and glycerol as the plasticizer.*

The first step in this process is to create the agar solution. To do this, you will need to:

1. Combine agar powder and water in a pot.

2. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the agar has dissolved.

3. Bring the mixture to a boil and then remove from heat.

4. Allow the mixture to cool slightly before adding the linen/flax.

5. Stir the mixture until the linen/flax is evenly distributed.

6. Finally, add the glycerol and stir until it is also evenly distributed.

The aim of this project is to create an environmentally friendly and sustainable eating utensil that can be composted after use. 

To make the utensil, I will first need to make a mold in the desired shape. I will then mix the agar, linen/flax, and glycerol together and pour the mixture into the mold. I will then let the mixture set and harden. Once it is set, I will remove the mold and the utensil will be ready to use.

The ingredients I have chosen are all natural, and they will biodegrade. The agar will provide the structure for the utensil, while the linen/flax will reinforce it. The glycerol will act as a plasticizer, making the utensil more flexible.

The main challenge we are facing is finding an all natural adhesive that will hold the agar and linen together. We are also struggling to find an all natural way to make the agar into a solid sheet. 



We are currently exploring using gelatin as the adhesive, as it is made from all natural ingredients and is already in a solid sheet form. We are also considering using chitosan as the adhesive, as it is made from all natural ingredients and has been shown to be effective in holding together agar and linen.

The first step is to create an agar-based gel. To do this, mix 1 part agar powder with 2 parts boiling water. Stir until the agar has dissolved, then pour the mixture into a mold. Allow the mold to cool and set for at least an hour.

Next, prepare the linen or flax fiber. For this step, you will need to soak the fibers in water for 24 hours. After soaking, the fibers should be soft and pliable.

To incorporate the fibers into the gel, first make a slurry by mixing the fibers with a small amount of water. Then, pour the slurry into the mold and mix it with the agar gel. Allow the mixture to set for another hour.

Finally, add the glycerol to the gel. This will act as a plasticizer, helping to make the gel more flexible. Add the glycerol slowly, stirring as you go, until the desired consistency is achieved.
